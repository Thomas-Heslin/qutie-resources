  <Say voice="alice">Hi Adrian. How was your day? The next episode of your favourite show Westworld is tonight.
  Last week on Westworld, Charlotte and Bernard track down the decommissioned Peter Abernathy only to be caught by the Confederados and separated.
  Dolores, who has secured support from the Confederados' leader Major Craddock, discovers that Peter is malfunctioning and orders Bernard to find the problem.
